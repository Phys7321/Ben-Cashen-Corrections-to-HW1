Challenge #1 looks good. I would just point out that it's always a good idea to tweak the graph to make it as clear as possible (referring to the MATLAB graph, which is a little tight towards the axes (yes, this is a very picky detail)). And when using fprintf or sprintf, it's a good idea to end with a new line character '\n'
AND homework 1 looks good - BUT I want you to do one more thing in the python file Deriv.py - write the syntax so all the plots are visible, right now each plot overwrites the previous one.
I'll look at your HW2 tomorrow (I'm assuming that you made corrections to that one.), my spouse is yelling for me to stop working.
